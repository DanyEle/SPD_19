This archive contains several files implementing the k-means algorithm
and a suitable data generator, to be used as a testing ground for
developing parallel versions.


kmeans.h

	include file with common types and the constants which define
	program behaviour

generatedata.c

	the data generator; accept two parameters, the number of
	centroids to use, and the number of chunks for splitting the
	file (up to you to implement); all other parameters are
	embeded in the code. 

	Output is on stdout, redirect the program to save it.

	A define in the program switches on and off real pseudorandom
	generation, instead of repeatable pseudorandom behaviour with
	constant seed.

kmeans.c

	the kmeans sequential algorithm; again, two parameters: number
	of centroids and number of chunks (unimplemented). 

	Note that you CAN look for a number of centroids different
	from the number you generated with (in the real world you have
	no information about the data distribution).

	Input and output are stdin and stdout.

util.c

	utility functions common to both C files

plotexample.gplot
plottest.gplot
plottest2.gplot

	gnuplot files for building the code and checking the results
	they employ some default names for the files they are loading,
	and they expact the input to be formatted in their own, simple
	way. So beware of additional printouts in the program.

Makefile

	several targets to build the generator and the algorithm, plus
	some (2D only) tests employing gnuplot to render the data

	plotexample : call the generator with 5 centroids, draw result
	in gnuplot

	test : on top o fhte plotexample data, run kmeans with 5 centroids

	test2 : same as before, but with a 15-centroid data file and
	kmeans run with 5 centroids
